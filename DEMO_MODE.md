# Demo Mode Implementation

This document explains the demo mode implementation for the Yield Delta application.

## Overview

Demo mode has been implemented to simulate deposit and withdrawal transactions without actually interacting with the blockchain. This is perfect for creating demo videos and presentations.

## Features

### 1. Deposit Simulation âœ…
- **Location**: `src/components/DepositModal.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Simulates successful deposit transactions with fake transaction hashes
- **UI Feedback**: Shows "DEMO MODE" indicator in the modal header
- **Process**: 
  1. User enters deposit amount
  2. Clicks "Deposit Now"
  3. Shows "Processing..." for 2 seconds
  4. Displays success message with fake transaction hash
  5. Redirects to vault overview after 3 seconds

### 2. Withdrawal Simulation âœ…
- **Location**: `src/components/CustomerVaultDashboard.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Simulates successful withdrawal transactions with fake transaction hashes
- **UI Feedback**: Shows "DEMO MODE" indicator in the dashboard header
- **Process**:
  1. User enters withdrawal shares amount
  2. Clicks "Withdraw Funds"
  3. Shows "Processing Withdrawal..." for 2 seconds
  4. Displays success message with transaction details
  5. Resets form after 5 seconds

### 3. AI-Powered Rebalancing Simulation âœ…
- **Location**: `src/app/portfolio/rebalance/page.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Simulates executing AI-recommended rebalancing actions
- **UI Feedback**: Shows "DEMO MODE" indicator in the page header
- **Process**:
  1. User views AI-generated rebalance recommendations
  2. Selects actions to execute
  3. Clicks "Execute Rebalance"
  4. Shows progressive execution with real-time progress bar
  5. Displays transaction hashes for each completed action
  6. Shows completion summary

### 4. Additional Features (Available but not simulated)
- **Liqui Chat**: Full ElizaOS AI integration for vault strategy discussions
- **Active Trades**: Real-time trade execution monitoring
- **Market Data**: Live market data and analytics dashboard

## Configuration

Demo mode is controlled by an environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
```

### To Enable Demo Mode:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` in your `.env.local` file
2. Restart your development server

### To Disable Demo Mode:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false` in your `.env.local` file (or remove the variable)
2. Restart your development server

## Implementation Details

### Success Messages
Both deposit and withdrawal simulations include:
- Loading states with spinner animations
- Success states with checkmark icons
- Fake transaction hashes for authenticity
- Proper state management and cleanup

### UI Indicators
- "DEMO MODE" badges are shown in modal/dashboard headers when active
- Different styling (green background) to make it clear this is demo mode
- Transaction status cards with appropriate colors and icons

### Timing
- **Deposit**: 2s processing â†’ 3s success display â†’ redirect
- **Withdrawal**: 2s processing â†’ 5s success display â†’ reset

## Demo Video Tips

### ðŸŽ¬ **Complete Demo Flow Suggestion:**

1. **Enable demo mode** before recording
2. **Start with Deposits**: Show 5 SEI deposit to a vault
3. **Show Withdrawal**: Withdraw some shares from vault dashboard  
4. **Demonstrate AI Rebalancing**: 
   - Navigate to `/portfolio/rebalance`
   - Select 2-3 recommended actions
   - Execute rebalance and show progress
5. **Highlight Key Features**:
   - Success messages and transaction hashes
   - "DEMO MODE" indicators for transparency
   - Real-time progress bars and status updates
   - Professional UI/UX throughout

### ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Demo Script:**
- "This is Yield Delta Core in demo mode - let me show you our key features"
- "First, let's deposit 5 SEI into this high-yield vault..."
- "Notice the realistic transaction processing and success confirmation"
- "Now let's check the AI-powered rebalancing recommendations..."
- "The AI has identified several optimization opportunities - let's execute them"
- "Watch the real-time progress as each transaction completes"

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `src/components/DepositModal.tsx`
   - Added demo mode state controlled by environment variable
   - Modified `handleDeposit` function with simulation logic
   - Added "DEMO MODE" UI indicator in modal header
   - Enhanced transaction status display

2. `src/components/CustomerVaultDashboard.tsx`
   - Added demo mode state and withdrawal status tracking
   - Modified `handleWithdraw` function with simulation logic
   - Added "DEMO MODE" UI indicator in dashboard header
   - Enhanced UI with transaction status cards and progress

3. `src/app/portfolio/rebalance/page.tsx` âœ¨ NEW
   - Added comprehensive rebalancing simulation
   - Progressive transaction execution with real-time progress
   - Multiple transaction hash generation
   - Execution status tracking and UI feedback
   - "DEMO MODE" indicator in page header

4. `.env.local`
   - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`

5. `DEMO_MODE.md` âœ¨ NEW
   - Complete documentation and usage guide

### Key Functions:
- **Deposit Simulation**: Bypasses blockchain calls, shows 2s loading, generates fake hash
- **Withdrawal Simulation**: Bypasses blockchain calls, shows status progression, includes transaction details

## Rollback Instructions

To revert to real blockchain transactions:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false` or remove the environment variable
2. Restart the application
3. The components will automatically use real blockchain transaction flows

## Future Enhancements

- Add more realistic transaction delays (5-10 seconds)
- Include gas fee simulation
- Add occasional "failure" simulations for more realistic demos
- Create admin panel to toggle demo mode without restart
