# SEI DLP Core - Production Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the additional implementation details required to transition the SEI Dynamic Liquidity Protocol (DLP) strategies from the current devnet mock contracts to production-ready contracts. The devnet contracts are simplified to focus on core infrastructure testing, while production contracts require integration with external protocols and more sophisticated logic.

## Strategy-Specific Production Implementation

### 1. Yield Farming Strategy (YieldFarmingVault.sol)

#### Current Devnet Implementation
- Simplified rebalancing with tick range updates
- No integration with external yield farming protocols
- Focus on testing AI oracle integration and core vault mechanics

#### Production Implementation Requirements

1. **External Protocol Integration**
   - Integrate with multiple yield farming protocols (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve)
   - Implement interfaces for interacting with these protocols
   - Manage liquidity across multiple pools

2. **Advanced Rebalancing Logic**
   - Withdraw liquidity from underperforming pools
   - Swap tokens to match target allocations
   - Deposit liquidity into new, higher-yielding pools
   - Implement slippage protection and optimal routing for swaps

3. **Staking and Compounding**
   - Stake LP tokens to earn additional rewards
   - Harvest rewards periodically
   - Compound returns by reinvesting harvested rewards
   - Implement reward tracking and distribution

4. **Cross-Chain Operations**
   - Bridge assets between chains using IBC or other cross-chain protocols
   - Manage positions on multiple chains simultaneously
   - Implement cross-chain yield optimization strategies

5. **Risk Management**
   - Monitor impermanent loss and adjust positions accordingly
   - Implement stop-loss mechanisms
   - Diversify across multiple protocols to reduce risk

#### Example Production Implementation

```solidity
function _executeYieldFarmingRebalance(AIRebalanceParams calldata params) internal {
    // 1. Withdraw from current yield farming pool
    IYieldFarm(currentFarm).withdraw(currentPosition.liquidity);

    // 2. Rebalance assets based on AI recommendations
    uint256 token0Balance = IERC20(vaultInfo.token0).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 token1Balance = IERC20(vaultInfo.token1).balanceOf(address(this));
    _rebalanceAssets(token0Balance, token1Balance, params.newAllocation);

    // 3. Deposit into new, higher-yielding farm
    address newFarm = IAIOracle(aiOracle).getRecommendedFarm(params);
    uint256 newLiquidity = IYieldFarm(newFarm).deposit(
        IERC20(vaultInfo.token0).balanceOf(address(this)),
        IERC20(vaultInfo.token1).balanceOf(address(this))
    );

    // 4. Stake LP tokens if applicable
    if (IYieldFarm(newFarm).hasStaking()) {
        IYieldFarm(newFarm).stake(newLiquidity);
    }

    // 5. Update position
    currentPosition.liquidity = newLiquidity;
    currentFarm = newFarm;
}
